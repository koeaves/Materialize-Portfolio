            In January 2018, I knew nothing about development. I had friends who explained software and web development to me with analogies
            and laymen's terms. I didn't even know how to write an anchor tag. Yet, I took a chance on my future. I decided to transition from teaching, and
            I enrolled in the University of Richmond's Full-Stack Web Development Bootcamp through the Center for Professional Studies. 
        </p>
        <p class = "font-style">
            Now, I can call myself a full-stack developer. I have built Node applications and used additional technologies such as:
            Node, Express, React, MySQL, MongoDB, and Firebase. I spent 6 months in a course in which I was pushed
            not only to learn a new written language but an entire new verbal language to describe my work. Because of the extensive work we have done
            in and out of class, I feel comfortable working in both front- and back-end development. I've written apps by myself and
            in teams of 3 to 4 (serving on both front- and back-end teams), I've learned my parameters and when to ask questions (and what language to use to ask the appropriate question),
            I've developed a different kind of analytic/logical thinking, and I'm working on extending my skills by studying other languages on my own.
        </p>
        <p class = "font-style">
            Full-stack development is very similar to planning curriculum, because I still have to think about how the consumer will 
            experience what I've designed, and I have to consider how information will be transferred from one source to another. The transition
            from teaching literature and composition to full-stack development has been easier than I anticipated. I still get to be analytic and creative, and
            I work on a team to determine the next best steps based on what we have done individually.
        </p>
        <p class = "font-style">  
            My new career is a challenging one, but I'm ready for it.
